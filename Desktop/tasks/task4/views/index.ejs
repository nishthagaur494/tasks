    <!-- ### **Exercise 4: User Profile Page with Route Parameters**

- **Objective**: Learn to handle route parameters and display dynamic content based on user input.
- **Instructions**:
    - Create a route `/profile/:username` that accepts a `username` parameter.
    - Render a profile page that dynamically shows the username passed in the URL.
    - Add additional data like the user’s age and favorite hobby, which is hard-coded in the backend based on the `username`.
- **Expected Output**: A page showing the user's profile, including their name, age, and hobby.
- **Challenge**: Display different content based on the user’s `username`. -->
        <!-- user input form for username -->
        
        <h1>User Profile</h1>
        <p>Username: <%= username %></p>
        <p>Age: <%= age %></p>
        <p>Hobby: <%= hobby %></p>
